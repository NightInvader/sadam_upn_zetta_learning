                                Gol D. Roger was known as the "Pirate King," the strongest and most infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. 
                                The capture and execution of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. 
                                His last words before his death revealed the existence of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece.
                                <br><br> 
                                It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece-which 
                                promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame-and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the Pirate King.
                                <br><br> 
                                Enter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate. 
                                Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun, 
                                Luffy's reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, 
                                the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, 
                                experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, 
                                all in order to reach the most coveted of all fortunes-One Piece.

                                There was once a great conflict known as the "Calamity War." Roughly 300 years have passed since the end of this war.
                                <br><br>
                                The Earth Sphere had lost its previous governing structure, and a new world was created under new systems of government. 
                                While a temporary peace had arrived, the seeds of a new conflict were being sown in the Mars Sphere, far away from Earth.
                                <br><br>
                                Our hero, a boy named Mikazuki Augus, belongs to a private security company called Chryse Guard Security (CGS). 
                                The company accepts a mission to escort Kudelia Aina Bernstein, 
                                a girl who seeks to liberate the Martian city of Chryse from the rule of one of Earth's major powers. 
                                However, the military organization Gjallarhorn attacks CGS in order to nip this rebellion in the bud. 
                                CGS begins an evacuation, using Mikazuki and the other children as decoys.
                                <br><br>
                                Orga Itsuka, the leader of the boys, decides to take this opportunity to rise up in revolt and launch a coup d'Ã©tat 
                                against the adults who have been oppressing them. He gives Mikazuki the task of repulsing Gjallarhorn, 
                                and Mikazuki enters battle using the Gundam Barbatos, a mobile suit from the Calamity War era which has been serving as CGS's power source.
